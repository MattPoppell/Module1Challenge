## Code Refactoring.

This project was inspired by a real-world need for existing code to be refactored. Often, this is a task for a new developer just starting out a new job.  
This project consisted of given starter-code that was then refactored to meet the acceptance criteria.  
Alternate information was provided for images and icons following accesibility standards in order to increase search engine optimization.
